Revision 4:
PPU_gen2 module created.
Added coe files for Donkey Kong.
Created 16KB PRG ROM.
Configured cart for Donkey Kong.
Created testbench.
Added CPU reset logic for simulation.
	CPU reset logic had been removed because it was broken (reset caused the CPU to freeze until a reset interrupt with nres).
	Fixed CPU reset logic.
Simulation and initial debugging complete.
	The first 8 pixels of the first line may not be drawn correctly.
	This may not get fixed in Gen 2, as it requires the prerender scanline.
	A bug causes graphical artefacts in Super Mario Bros, but this is likely a problem with the rest of the system and not the PPU.

Revision 5:
Created new project in Vivado 2019.1.
Created new vram and wram modules.
Fixed bug in spr_y_compare logic.
Fixed bug in ri (address was being incremented early in 2007 reads).
Fixed timing bug that caused the image to be shifted left by one pixel.

Revision 6:
Created new project in Quartus (18.1)
Created new vram and wram modules.
Created new cart module.
Added synchronizer to reset input.
Removed nres input from CPU module.
Found hardware bug in DragonBoard (RGB resistors swapped).
Changed RGB pin assignments.
Created SDRAM_SP8_I module.
Created I2C_EEPROM module.
Added I2C_phy module.
Modified cart_02 module to use SDRAM and EEPROM memories.
Created new testbench for SDRAM and I2C debugging.

Revision 7:
Created new joypad module.
Simplified APU clock divider.
Tweaked PPU palette.
Created new APU frame counter module.
Created new envelope generator module.
Created new apu_pulse module.
Created new apu_length_counter.
Created new mixer module.
Created new DMA module.
Created new APU module.
Fixed bug in DMA module.
Fixed bug in PPU (v_tile overflow should not toggle v_name).
Found bug in CPU (crash on IRQ).
Created DMC module.
Fixed bug in DMA module.
Replaced CPU module with T65.
Created mapper 71 cart.
